              Once upon a time, in a forest, there lived a clever fox. One day, the fox saw a crow on a tree branch with a piece of cheese in its beak. The fox wanted the cheese, so he called out, "Dear Crow, your feathers are so beautiful!
              I've heard you have a wonderful voice. Would you sing for me?" Flattered, the crow opened its beak to sing, and the cheese fell to the ground. The fox quickly ate the cheese. Realizing it had been tricked, the crow learned a
              valuable lesson: never trust a flatterer. The fox walked away, pleased with his cleverness, while the crow flew away, wiser from the experience.

              Once upon a time, a hardworking ant was gathering food for the winter. A grasshopper, who was singing and enjoying the summer, mocked the ant for working so hard. "Why don't you relax?" the grasshopper asked. The ant replied,
              "I'm preparing for winter. You should do the same." Winter came, and the grasshopper had nothing to eat, while the ant had plenty. The grasshopper begged the ant for food, but the ant reminded him of his laziness during the
              summer.
