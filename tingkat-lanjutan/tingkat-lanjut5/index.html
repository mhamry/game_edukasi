              Elephants are the largest land animals, recognized for their large ears, long trunks, and thick, gray skin. There are two species: African and Asian elephants. African elephants, larger with big ears, can weigh up to 6,000
              kilograms and stand 3.3 meters tall. Asian elephants are smaller, weighing up to 5,500 kilograms and standing about 2.7 meters tall, with smaller ears. African elephants live in sub-Saharan Africa, while Asian elephants are
              found in India and Southeast Asia. They inhabit various environments, including savannas and forests. Elephants are herbivores, eating grasses, leaves, fruits, and bark. An adult consumes up to 300 kilograms of food and 100
              liters of water daily. Elephants are intelligent and social, living in herds led by a matriarch. They communicate with various sounds, from trumpets to low-frequency rumbles. Elephants are threatened by habitat loss and
              poaching for ivory. Conservation efforts aim to protect these animals and their environments.

              Dolphins are intelligent marine mammals known for their playful behavior. They belong to the Delphinidae family and live in oceans worldwide. Dolphins have streamlined bodies, gray coloring, and elongated snouts called
              rostrums. They inhabit both coastal and deeper waters, from tropical to temperate regions. Dolphins are carnivores, eating fish and squid. They use echolocation to hunt. Dolphins are social and live in groups called pods. They
              communicate using clicks, whistles, and body language, and are known for acrobatic displays. Some dolphin species face threats from pollution, habitat loss, and fishing nets. Conservation efforts aim to protect them.

              Sunflowers are tall, bright flowers from the genus Helianthus, native to North America. They have large, yellow petals and a dark center filled with small florets. Sunflowers can grow 1.5 to 3.5 meters tall. Sunflowers thrive
              in temperate and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and full sunlight. Sunflowers are grown for their seeds, used as snacks and for producing sunflower oil. They are also popular as ornamental plants. Easy to
              grow, sunflowers need full sun and well-drained soil. Seeds are planted in spring and harvested in late summer or early autumn. Sunflowers are not endangered and are widely cultivated. Proper care is needed to protect them
